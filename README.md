# Transferring from apt to nala

***Disclaimer: This repository is only for Debian-based linux distros where bash or fish is default shell. ***

Everyone knows that apt is better than nala right? Well, of course, but what if you want to change your system so that when you run `apt`, nala runs? Well, this repository takes care of that. All you need to do is to download the .sh file, run it (check the contents if you want), and that's it!
